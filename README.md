# Image Inpainting Model

This project implements a deep learning model for image inpainting using PyTorch. The model is based on the U-Net architecture and can be used to fill in missing or damaged regions of an image.

## Features

- **U-Net Architecture**: The model uses a convolutional encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to effectively learn the task of image inpainting.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: The code is written in PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, making it easy to train, evaluate, and deploy the model.
- **Customizable Dataset**: The model uses a custom dataset class that can be easily adapted to work with your own dataset of original and masked images.
- **Easy to Use**: The provided `main()` function allows you to train the model with just a few lines of code, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users.

## Getting Started

To use the Image Inpainting Model, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - PyTorch (version 1.7.0 or later)
   - torchvision
   - Pillow
   - Tensorflow

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-inpainting-model.git
   cd image-inpainting-model
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Create two directories, one for the original images and one for the masked images.
   - Place your dataset files in the respective directories.
   - Update the `original_dir` and `masked_dir` variables in the `InpaintingDataset` class to point to your dataset paths.

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Adjust the hyperparameters (batch size, number of epochs, learning rate) in the `main()` function as needed.
   - Run the `main()` function to start the training process.
   - The trained model will be saved as `inpainting_model.pth`.

5. **Use the Trained Model**:
   - Load the trained model using `torch.load('inpainting_model.pth')`.
   - Use the model to generate inpainted images by passing in the masked input images.

Feel free to explore the code, customize the model architecture, and experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters to achieve the best results for your use case.
